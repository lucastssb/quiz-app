## ðŸ’» Project

This is my first application written in Go. Just a simple quiz app.

## :rocket: Technologies

This app was made using the following technologies:
- [Go][go]
## :information_source: How To Run

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) + [Go][go] installed on your computer.
